730Hours Design Brief
=====================

A brief summary of the business / site goals.
---------------------------------------------

You are what you do. This is personal budgeting applied to time, not money: You Need a [Time] Budget. Based around the ideas that personal change that you do not "fund" with time will not happen, and that you cannot improve what you do not measure. 

The key users.
--------------

Users are motivated but time-poor (by definition). They are analytical, with a high level of introspection and goal adherence, but absolutely do not need more chores and busywork in their life. 

Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
-------------------------------------------------

**Time tracking**: Many times per hour, always on mobile. Handled by an external app (SaveMyTime) and not part of this project.

**Monthly review/planning session**: User reviews results against plans for previous month, notes reasons for variances, and sets a plan for the coming month. Focused, detailed session (>5 mins, maybe >15 mins). Probably happens on desktop. 

**Ad-hoc review session**: User reviews progress against plan during a month. Could be as short as a quick glance. Almost certainly happens on mobile.

Design style guidelines to follow.
-----------------------------------

**Fast fast fast fast fast**. Users are busy, don't like doing this, and will eagerly accept any excuse to context-switch away from it. One second of lag is probably okay; three seconds, anywhere in the application, is definitely too long.

**Businesslike**. Think "budget variance analysis in Xero", not "new badges awarded in Candy Crush". This is a power tool; it's not meant to be fun. 

**Focused**. Users are busy. Make them do only what they have to do. Prioritise actionable information. Be respectful of the user's attention.
